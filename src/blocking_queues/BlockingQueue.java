 *         A blocking queue is a queue that blocks when you try to dequeue from
 *         it and the queue is empty, or if you try to enqueue items to it and
 *         the queue is already full. A thread trying to dequeue from an empty
 *         queue is blocked until some other thread inserts an item into the
 *         queue. A thread trying to enqueue an item in a full queue is blocked
 *         until some other thread makes space in the queue, either by dequeuing
 *         one or more items or clearing the queue completely.
